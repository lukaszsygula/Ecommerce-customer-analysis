In this project, I'll analyze customer data from an NYC-based e-commerce company selling clothing online and offering style advice in-store. My aim is to guide their decision on improving either the mobile app or website.

Project Assumptions:

- Customer data analysis: focusing on app/website usage time and in-store sessions.
- Linear regression: exploring how app/website usage influences purchases.
- App vs. website comparison: determining customer preferences for purchases.
- Recommendations: suggesting strategies to enhance customer experience and boost online sales.
  
This project will let me apply data analysis and regression techniques practically, providing valuable insights and strategies for the company's online sales improvement.
